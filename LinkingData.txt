Once on the FeaturedArtist page the user needs to be able to select 3 featured artist, which represents the different genres
A suggestion page should appear that gives 2 FaveNewArtist for each of the 3 featured artist selected. The 3 featured artist is a representation of the genres
There is a Genre class that was created that shows the different genre and there was a repository and controller created as well but they opted not to use it.
Data is being pulled from the database which is pulling the content from a text file which list the artist and their genre
I know that this is going to be a one to many relationship I'm just unsure of how to do this without having the genre class
 
 The featured artist controller needs to link to the get recommendations/recommendations html file
 the featured artist controller needs to pull the database for the featured artists and fave new artists
 The fave new artist controller needs to populate the data for the fave new artists 

 Recommedations html needs to be designed

 Select html page is not working
