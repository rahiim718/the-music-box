        <h3>Our Journey</h3>
        <p>
        After an intense 4 months of rigid course work and challenging coding projects, 
        this group was formed from the fire of individuals that were refined and able 
        to preserver to the end. While many others were lost along the way, each of us 
        were placed into a combined Code Jam due to the low numbers of our original 
        cohort and having met for the first time we each placed ourselves in an open 
        frame of mind. Not knowing what to expect we ALL were willing to devote as much 
        time as needed in order to deliver an ideal product. Met with strenuous obstacles 
        of learning another software system as well as panning out the different coding 
        objectives, full-time employment with Amazon and learning one another we each 
        were able to bring our abilities to the table in order to produce “The Music Box”. 
        “The Music Box” was a brilliant idea presented by our Product Manager, Tristan Eason. 
        Tristan presented his idea to us along with his color schemes for the design and 
        instantly the team saw his vision and produced the brilliant work you are seeing 
        here today. Through adversity we all have made it to the finish line and would like 
        to welcome you to enjoy….The Music Box.</p>
