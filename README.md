WCCI PT Java B - Final Project

-The Fave New Artist website will provide a variety of new/different artists to listen to,
based on artists/genres you like.

-Upon visiting the site the user will enter their name and be greeted.
-A list of well known artists should display and the user would be asked to select up to 3 artists.
-Based on the artists selected, the user should be suggested up to two NEW artists within the same genre. 

-The user should be able to see a picture of the artist, be given a brief description of the artist,
and be provided with a link to their YouTube video.

There can be up to 8 genres to choose from, for now the most popular would be:
Hip Hop/Rap
R&B
Pop
Country
Rock

-Lastly, there should be an option to bypass selecting well known artist and select genres instead.
